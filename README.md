Objective: The Highlander simulator project aimed to develop a dynamic application for simulating battles between "Good" and "Bad" Highlanders within a grid-based environment. The primary goal was to create an engaging platform where users could witness Highlander interactions and observe outcomes based on different simulation options.

Implementation: The project followed a structured approach, incorporating object-oriented principles and modular design. Utilizing C# and the Windows Universal Platform (UWP), the application embraced the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for efficient data binding and UI management. Key functionalities, including Highlander movement, interaction handling, and outcome determination, were implemented through well-defined classes and methods.

To enhance code maintainability and readability, essential features such as grid display, Highlander placement, and simulation controls were organized into distinct modules. The project leveraged asynchronous programming for responsive UI updates during simulation execution, ensuring smooth user experience throughout.

Technological Stack: The Highlander simulator was built using C# programming language and the Windows Universal Platform (UWP) framework. It utilized XAML for declarative UI design and data binding, enabling seamless integration of UI components with underlying logic. Asynchronous programming techniques were employed to handle time-consuming operations without blocking the main thread, ensuring fluid interaction and responsiveness.

In summary, the Highlander simulator project represents a cohesive integration of modern software development practices and innovative technologies. By combining C# programming expertise with UWP framework capabilities, the application delivers an immersive simulation experience for users. With its intuitive interface and robust functionality, the Highlander simulator offers a captivating platform for exploring Highlander dynamics and observing simulation outcomes in real-time.
